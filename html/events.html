                Every month, The GIVING charity organises blood donation events in different locations in
                Jordan. We work together with local partners, Red Cross branches and volunteers to bring
                these events close to the donors.
                The Blood Service donation has permanent offices in four cities: Amman, Irbid , Azzarqa and
                Mafruq.
                Where are the blood donation events organised?
                We visit nearly 60 different locations and organise a total of about 100 blood donation
                events each year. The choice of the location is affected by the amount of eligible donors
                living in and around the location, and other such factors. We must collect at least 70â€“80
                bags of blood in one event for the donation event to be worth the efforts.

                Crafts, handicrafts, practices and various products, made by hands who work in their homes,
                participate in a charity bazaar. The proceeds go to support the poor families and orphans.
                By marketing these products, it aims to support poor families and orphans, especially the poor
                students in the less fortunate regions.
